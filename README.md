# k8split
shoddy split keyboard for personal use, after ruining my [chinese split keyboard](http://xahlee.info/kbd/ly092_mini_keyboard.html) I attempted to recreate what I wanted from that, minus all the annoyances.

## features
-  *normal* layout: 
	- no ortho
	- no lack of function row
	- no weird thumbclusters
	- plenty bonus keys to add what you miss
- no case or plate, only M3 holes
- powered by [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
- identical matrix wiring on both halves, only keymaps differ
